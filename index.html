           <b> Abstract of the Project </b>  
            <br>

            Given a picture captured from a camera hooked up to a vehicle moving on a road during which captured road
            might not be leveled, or have clearly described edges then road detection from one image will be applied to
            search out the road in a picture so it might be used as a district in automation of driving system within the
            vehicles for moving the vehicle in correct road. During this method of finding the road within the image 
            captured by the vehicle, we are able to use some algorithms for vanishing point 
            detection, exploitation of Hough Transformation Space, finding the region of interest, edge detection exploitation,
            Canny edge detection for road detection. We have a tendency to use thousands of pictures of various roads to coach our model
            so the model might notice the road as a result within the new image processed through the vehicle,simultaneously it also detects 
            objects on the road using a haar cascade.

          <h3>Step 2:Applying different-different Algorithms </h3>
          <img src="" alt="">
          <p style="text-align: justify">
          
            <ol style="text-align: left;">
              <p>1.)HSV COLOR SELECTION : Converting videos to frames and than the Lane lines in the test the images are in white or yellow.
                 We need to choose the most suitable color space, that clearly highlights the lane lines. We applied color selection to the 
                 original RGB images, HSV images, and HSL images, and found out that using HSL will be the best color space to use.</p>


              <p> 2.GAUSSIAN BLUR: The Canny edge detection algorithm measures the intensity gradients
                 of each pixel. So, we need to convert the images into grayscale in order to detect edges.
                 Apply Gaussian Smoothing : Since all edge detection results are easily affected by image noise, it is essential to filter out 
                the noise to prevent false detection caused by noise. To smooth the image, a Gaussian filter is applied to convolve with the image.
                 It will slightly smooth the image to reduce the effects of obvious noise on the edge detector.
              </p>
              &nbsp;
              
              
              <p>3.) CANNY EDGE DETECTION: We need to detect edges in the images to be able to correctly detect lane lines. The Canny edge detector is an edge 
                detection operator that uses a multi-stage algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images. The Canny algorithm involves the following steps:
                <li> the intensity gradients of the image.</li>
              <li>Apply non-maximum suppression to get rid of spurious response to edge detection.</li>
            <li>Apply a double threshold to determine potential edges.</li>
          <li>Track edge by hysteresis</li>
              </p>
              
              <p> 4.) REGION OF SELETION : We're interested in the area facing the camera, where the lane lines are found. So, we'll
                 apply region masking to cut out everything else. And we will cut the a polygon shape in the image and 
                 than track the lane accordingly.Bounding Boxes is the most important way to resolve this problem.</p>

                 &nbsp; &nbsp;

              <p>5.) Hough Transformation : The Hough transform is a technique which can be used to isolate features of a particular shape
                 within an image. Basically we use it to detected the lane lines in the region of selection in the particular area selected.

             &nbsp; 

             <p style="text-align:left">2.) AVERAGE-SLOPE-INTERCEPT :We have multiple lines detected for each lane line. We need to average all these lines and draw a single line
               for each lane line. We also need to extrapolate the lane lines to cover the full lane line length.

            it makes the project more convincing and detects the lane line in appropriate manner.

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            When we drive, we use our vision to decide where to go. The lines on the road detected by the model that show us where the lanes are
             act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle. This steering is also done automatically. Naturally, one of the first 
             things we would like to do in developing a self-driving vehicle is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm. The road
          detection region of interest (ROI), must be flexible. When driving up or down a steep incline, the horizon will change and no longer
            be a product of the proportions of the frame. This is also something to consider for tight turns and bumper to bumper traffic.
             This model is based on image processing and road detection in self-driving vehicles which has a great scope in future. We
            use specific algorithms in step process implementation to detect the road clearly. If people's thoughts haven't changed about
             self-driving cars being safe, these cars are already safe and are becoming safer. Users will give a try to newer technology; 
           they get to enjoy the luxury of computerized driving. Driverless vehicles appear to be an important next step in transportation
            technology. They are a new all-media capsule- text to your heart’s desire and it’s safe. Developments in autonomous vehicles are
             continuing and the software development is continuing to be updated. Though it all started from a driverless thought to 
            radio frequency, cameras, sensors, more semi autonomous features will come up, thus reducing the congestion, increasing
             the safety with faster reactions and fewer errors.
